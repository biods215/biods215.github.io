## Assignments

Please submit all the assignments via Canvas.

Late day policy. Students have 6 late days in total. We allow a maximum of 2 days per assignment.

### Reading Materials

We ask students to write a paragraph about the reading materials and/or the corresponding lecture. Here is the instructions:

- Please read the reading materials posted on the class website and write a paragraph about it. You may write more if you want.
- You can write anything regarding the reading material and/or the corresponding lecture.
- You may also include comments and/or request regarding the teaching style. We appreciate your feedback!
- Please submit your answer through Canvas as one pdf document.

### Problem set 1

Will be updated tonight.


### Class project

We think the class project is a great opportunity for you to use some of the methods you will learn in the class. To allocate sufficient time to work on the project, we would like to have the brief project proposal by the third week of the quarter 1/26/2021.

## Lecture materials

We will post the list of lecture slides and reading materials here.
